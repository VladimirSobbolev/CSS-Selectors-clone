# CSS Diner clone

This project is clone of  [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/).

## WHY?

I started doing this project to learn how to REACT. And what could be better than practice?

## REACT

This is my first project made using the __react__ framework

## This is what we ended up with

[CSS Diner clone](https://VladimirSobbolev.github.io/CSS-Selectors-clone/)
